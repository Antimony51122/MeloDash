In order to achieve a more natural and fluent effect, the sprites have been traced over the animations done by Richard Williams. The quality of the animation not only afftect asthetic but also playerâ€™s experience. if the animation itself wobbles a lot it will influence the way player perceive visual feedback from the character.

The animations have been created using Unity Animation tab. All animations are appended to the Player object:

The character has 5 basic postures according to different circumstances:

- **Running**: the posture of running on the ground, if the character doesn't perform any other tasks, running will be the default posture.
- **Jump**: where the girl jumps to space, the character may continuously keep jumping in the space.
- **Fall**: the falling posture occurring right after jumping. 
- **Glide**: which is middle transition progress from the previous posture to the keeping gliding gesture.
- **Gliding**: where the girl keeps the continuous gliding gesture.
