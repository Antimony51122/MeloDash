In order to achieve a more natural and fluent effect, the sprites have been traced over the animations done by Richard Williams. The quality of the animation not only afftect asthetic but also playerâ€™s experience. if the animation itself wobbles a lot it will influence the way player perceive visual feedback from the character.
