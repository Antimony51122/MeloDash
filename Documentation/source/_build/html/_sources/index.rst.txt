Melodash is a running game based on real time music analysis. Player’s objective is to dodge obstacles that are automatically generated by the music. Our group’s focus was to develop the game further by completing the beat detection, and adding extra features such as music visualisation and bonus. Beat detection was taken place by analysing two elements of the music: frequency band and  energy of the signal. Beats in different frequencies were categorised to different types of obstacles. If a beat is detected, the obstacles will be generated in the game immediately. Using these features, obstacles are more diverse and the speed of game can be automatically calibrated.
